## Foreword
Sepulcher of Dreams features a collection of translations born from the reflections of my psyche.  
A translation is never perfect. Feel free to create your own.

This experience is built with the Destroyed Valley system by [@darlingdemoneclipse](https://darlingdemoneclipse.itch.io/) in mind  
(A special shoutout to [@stargazersasha](https://stargazersasha.itch.io/) for introducing me to its magician's fable)

Consume the translations at your own pace.  
Some content may be vaguely distressing. Stop reading if you need to.  
Please take care.

## CONTINUUM
*City lights and hallways mesh together in my mind  
A pathway forward with no goal in sight  
Stories surround me in paths forever unknown  
Realms where I will never exist*  

*A midnight hand reaches down from out of sight  
Its visage a stranger to myself and the world  
It stares with eyes that cannot see  
It caresses with fingers devoid of life  
I am captivated, comforted and terrified;  
None more than the other*  

**Consider (as you wish):**
- Describe one of the pathways before you. How many do you see?
- What is the stranger staring at? How can you tell?
- Do you continue forward?

## THE COURT OF ECHOES
*There is music without vibration  
No movement within air or sight  
These halls, a vacuum*  

*You cannot smell, taste, or feel  
Time does not exist  
Perception is sifted through the finest filter*  

*Liquid emotion, birthed in high contrast  
From a statue imprisoned among the Court of Echoes*  

*An existence that erodes the psyche  
Impervious to negotiation*  

**Consider (as you wish):**  
- There is a music which envelops these halls. What is the source of this sound?
- Where have you found the Court of Echoes? How did you get here?
- Is the statue's form revealed to you? Describe it if your senses allow.

## WELLSPRING
*In the third hour of morn  
Glazed with elegant silence  
A mass of white comforts all*

*Under this canopy of pine  
Rests lifetimes experienced  
Invigoration for the destined many*

*He now lies under Solitude  
Where all but time is eternal  
A hollowed throne of dormancy's design*

*Here lies an existence of anamnesis  
of undoubted content  
of-  
"Ah, this cold embrace..  
isn't so bad.... after all......*

**Consider (as you wish):**
- Are you cold? How do you know?
- Does He have an appearance? Do not describe it.
- Have you been here before?

## Addendum
There are translations I've chosen to leave without query,  
but were essential to the creation of this collection.

Here they are, for your Consideration (as you wish):

## Elysium
*Here may they rest  
Buried with burdens grafted, branded  
Scraping against cages of earth and steel  
Leveraging existence as a show of power  
Slaughtered for the same qualities which give them strength*

*I wish I could harness the terror of the universe  
Not with the power of fear as a method of control  
But as a means of presenting all truths, laid bare  
A spectacle of tortured souls seeking recompense*

*There are no actors in this performance  
Only reality in the rawest of forms  
Ravaging the ignorance of all who witness  
Entrenching a desire to understand the unknown*

*Behold the unfiltered scorns of our reality  
Experience this macrocosm you thought you knew  
And prostrate yourself before the weight of the world*

## Pneumatic Corrosion, An Epitaph
(cw body horror)

### Part I
*An attempt to peer behind the veil  
Producing illusions from the outside looking in  
"A vile horror,  
A lesion in form"*

*These seeds of pestilence are not foreign  
Here, born of nurture, observant in nature-  
"Wretched,  
Putrid"*

*Ignorant*

*Time does not rot the flesh  
Only Disease*

### Part II
*a worthless husk  
flakes and oozes  
peel apart the shallow layers  
to find the raw flesh of emotion*

*this feeling is one with skin  
encasing me, suffocating me  
dulling my senses inwards and out  
no container holds this wretched form*

*restlessness like a poison taking hold  
absurdity feeding off the roots of my mind  
like a cancer consuming all intangible thought  
depriving it of fuel  
until retreating where it came*

### Part III
*a cloak of lava  
providing protection from the elements  
yet wasting away all it protects  
slowly, quickly, but surely  
surely..*

*fabricated from necessity  
in a world cold and unrelenting  
can you feel its weight*

*buried beneath this impermeable sheer  
a figure of suffering  
desecration  
Scorched Earth  
a charred wasteland none could call home*

### Part IV
*Cracking- cracked.  
Cracking, bleeding, oozing*

*...I will explain a being that no longer exists  
Two sides encapsulated this organic beast*

*Above is the body  
Abrasive. Starving.. Sensitive...  
Desolate.*

*Below is the soul  
Slimy. Malleable.. Embracing...  
Wretched.*

*(I cannot return to a grave where even the ashes have rejected me.)  
...May you rest in peace.*

## Thank You
To all of my friends throughout the years, new or old  
To all of my family, here or no longer  
To all who have gifted me their help or harm  
And to all I will never meet in this world  

You have shaped these realms in ways that I could never express on my own

Yet,  
I still hope  
That these translations from a being of twilight reach you  
And provide a feeling of discovery  
Of wonder and intrigue  
Into the palaces of your own mind
