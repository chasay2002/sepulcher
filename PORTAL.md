# SEPULCHER OF DREAMS
## PNEUMATIC CORROSION, AN EPITAPH
### `I`
```
An attempt to peer behind the veil
Producing illusions from the outside looking in
"A vile horror,
A lesion in form"

These seeds of pestilence are not foreign
Here, born of nurture, observant in nature-
"Wretched,
Putrid"

Ignorant

Time does not rot the flesh
Only Disease
```
### `II`
```
a worthless husk
flakes and oozes
peel apart the shallow layers
to find the raw flesh of emotion

this feeling is one with skin
encasing me, suffocating me
dulling my senses inwards and out
no container holds this wretched form

restlessness like a poison taking hold
absurdity feeding off the roots of my mind
like a cancer consuming all intangible thought
depriving it of fuel until retreating where it came
```
### `III`
```
a cloak of lava
providing protection from the elements
yet wasting away all it protects
slowly, quickly, but surely
surely..

fabricated from necessity
in a world cold and unrelenting
can you feel its weight

buried beneath this impermeable sheer
a figure of suffering
desecration
a charred wasteland none could call home
```
### `IV`
```
Scorched Earth

Cracking- cracked.
Cracking, bleeding, oozing

...I will explain a being that no longer exists

Two sides encapsulated this organic beast

Above is the body
Abrasive. Starving.. Sensitive...
Desolate.

Below is the soul
Slimy. Malleable.. Embracing...
Wretched.

(I cannot return to a grave where even the ashes have rejected me.)
...
May you rest in peace.
```

## CONTINUUM
```
City lights and hallways mesh together in my mind
A pathway forward with no goal in sight
Stories surround me in paths forever unknown
Realms where I will never exist

A midnight hand reaches down from out of sight
Its visage a stranger to myself and the world
It stares with eyes that cannot see
It caresses with fingers devoid of life
I am captivated, comforted and terrified; none more than the other
```

## THE COURT OF ECHOES
```
Cobblestone
Velvet
Timber

There is music without vibration
No movement within air or sight
These halls, a vacuum

You cannot smell, taste, or feel
Time does not exist
Perception is sifted through the finest filter

Liquid emotion birthed in high contrast
From a statue imprisoned among the court of echoes
Eroding the psyche, impervious to negotiation
```

## ELYSIUM
```
Here may they rest
Buried with burdens grafted, branded
Scraping against cages of earth and steel
Leveraging existence as a show of power
Slaughtered for the same qualities which give them strength

I wish I could harness the terror of the universe
Not with the power of fear as a method of control
But as a means of presenting all truths, laid bare
A spectacle of tortured souls seeking recompense

There are no actors in this performance
Only reality in the rawest of forms
Ravaging the ignorance of all who witness
Entrenching a desire to understand the unknown

Behold the unfiltered scorns of our reality
Experience this macrocosm you thought you knew
And prostrate yourself before the weight of the world
```

## WELLSPRING
```
In the third hour of morn
Glazed with elegant silence
A mass of white comforts all

Under this canopy of pine
Rests lifetimes experienced
Invigoration for the destined many

He now lies under Solitude
Where all but time is eternal
A hollowed throne of dormancy's design

Here lies an existence of anamnesis
of undoubted content
of-
"Ah, this cold embrace
isn't so bad
after all........
```

## SABLE
```
the night and the dark are not the same

the night is a duration easily measurable
it begins and ends unhindered, yet dictated, by the divine
the dark.. is born from observation
one may say a lack thereof
but the dark is always relative
it is always, a relative

In this room of scientific temperature
A body is found
Not a husk or a shell
Of average proportion in the physical sense

A relative
A resident
A resistor of the dark

Where is it now

the being exists in a space undefined
not the by dark or its contents
not by its owner or resident
yet called by a name to meaninglessly marker an existence

In this dark
not Of this dark

outstretched
the Senses are fleeting

observation
the Senses are fleeing-
Contraction

"Jamais Vu"
A moment unfortunately peculiar

Associate now with the dark
Relate to the world lesser witnessed
Delegation void of disconnection
Its vision a reflection of the abyss
Primal emotion involuntarily recalled

What are you Now,
Resident of the dark?
```

## FIVE ZERO FIVE
```
I'm empty

Low on fuel

I always move forward

It's a different road
Where no one else is on the path

I sometimes see another
Rolling in
a passerby
An invited guest
Their detour always momentary
always appreciated

On this long desert road
There's a storm approaching fast
Coming of the season
I hope it's not as long as the last
As lonely as the last

It won't be

But I'll have to detour this time
Of my own volition
Exit this selfish road
A passerby is not enough
I can't do this alone anymore
```
